Abstract:
 In this report, I explain what I did in com3551-B lecture project. Project is self-driving car in a
simulation. Also, I write some information about self-driving and existing self-driving project (Nvidia).
  Problem:
 One of the important problems of today is traffic accidents. Every day, every hour
someone dies for this reason. Otherwise, most of the people stuck in traffic, every day. Also, the
physical difficulties of driving can be included in problem. As a result, human error in daily traffic is
main problem in project.
 Projectâ€™s Aim:
 In traffic, eliminating human error so prevent traffic accidents and driving difficulties.
To do this use self-driving car that is creating by artificial neural networks. It is important to solving
the problem. Additionally, testing artificial neural network in simulation and seeing the results and
improving the solution is aim of the project.
 Self-driving car that are an important part of today. My project is about this. In the
project, firstly I collected data from simulation (manual driving) and trained this data to CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network) then test it in simulation.
